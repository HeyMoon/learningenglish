1. My aunt had to care for her elderly mother for years.
2. I can't tell whether Mia is happy or not; she never shows her feelings/emotions.
3. I'm much more energetic in the mornings. By the afternoon I feel tired.
4. Weather has a big effect on the way I feel.
5. He's been under a lot of stress recently because of the amount of work he has to do.
6. Oliver's cheerful one minute and miserable the next; his mood changes all the time.
7. It's been a depressing month, but I'm hopeful things will get better next month.
8. I don't like walking home in the dark. I get very scared.
